### Context:
I started working on this project on Friday evening. On Saturday, I accidentally deleted my project on GitHub but luckily I had my my VS code open and I was able to copy and paste what I had before it refreshed. I worked on my code throughout the weekend for roughly 6+ hours.

### Contributors:
I worked on this project alone.

### Learning Goals:
- Create a working HTML and CSS
- Gain a deeper understanding on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all interconnect to make an application

### Wins: 
- I started off with multiple functions that called each radio button individually. The code block was functioning but after a few hours on google, I was able to create a function using an if statement that was able to combine the four previous functions into one.
- Catching little errors like mispelling of a class list! If I was stuck on an error for 10 minutes I would take a POM. I found that taking longer POMs have help me immensely! I notice that when I take 30+ minute POMs, I come back with a fresh pair of eyes. 

### Challenges:
- Making my radio buttons appear as a column instead of a row. That alone took most of my sunday googling and trying to figure out why, even when I had my flex direction as column, it wasn't functioning the way I expected it to.
-A big challege I faced was implementing the hidden feature. I struggled understanding the concept. Personally, I felt like MDN is not clear on the topic. I phoned a Turing alumni and she was able to give me a better, beginner friendly, understanding of the function.
